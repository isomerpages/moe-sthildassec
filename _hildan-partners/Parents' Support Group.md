PARENTS SUPPORT GROUP
---------------------

Overview
--------

Our parent community continue to grow from strength to strength as new parents join the Parent Support Group. At St. Hilda’s Secondary School, we recognise the importance of parents as a partner in the development of the students and fully support our parents in strengthening their parenting skills through the FamilyMatters@Schools programme. It is very heartening to see our parents dedicating their Saturday mornings to engage experts as they pick up tips and new skills on how to better engage their teenagers. It is certainly not just about the serious matters as our parents also have fun as they support our school events. Many of you would have seen our PSG members playing the pie face game during the carnival and decked out in their ethnic costumes during the Racial Harmony Day celebrations. We are grateful to the generous contributions from parents as they gave out free food taster samples during Racial Harmony Day, bought biscuits for our Night Study Programme and contributed to the graduation gift for the Class of 2019.
