PARTNERSHIP WITH SPORTS SINGAPORE
---------------------------------


Based on the high pupils’ satisfaction and engagement in sports in St. Hilda’s Secondary School, the popularity of our sports programmes both at competitive and recreational levels and in view of sports and outdoor education as good platforms for the development of character, the Learning for Life (LLP) programme in St. Hilda’s Secondary School is to ‘Develop a Whole Person through Sports and Outdoor Education’.

Sport Singapore is our LLP partner in the ‘Game for Life’ Programme that features the use of game activities and specific role playing for the learning and development of performance, social and moral values and attributes in sports and outdoor education.

Other possible areas of partnership with Sport Singapore is the provision of educational and experience in the variety of roles related to sports or outdoor activities and contribution to sporting or outdoor-related events and programmes with community focus.
