NELLIE MITCHELL PROGRAMME
-------------------------

Overview
--------

The Nellie Mitchell Programme (NMP) is our signature talent management programme that allows Secondary Two students to apply their learning in a new context and experience learning across disciplines. NMP consists of three distinct programmes across the sciences, humanities, English Language and art disciplines.  
  
In the science programme, our students learnt the workings of the microbial fuel cells and how it could be an alternative energy source which is environmentally friendly. A project borne out from a collaboration with NIE, this has been a key feature of the NMP and reflects a unique strength of the Science department.

In conjunction with the school’s 85th anniversary celebrations, the humanities NMP students took the opportunity to undertake a project to interview ex-Hildans and curate good stories about the school through the years. This culminated in a video presentation that was screened during the Founders’ Day celebrations and brought everyone down memory lane.
