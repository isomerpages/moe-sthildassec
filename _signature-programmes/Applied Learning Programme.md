APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME
--------------------------

St Hilda’s Secondary School’s ALP started in 2015. The objective of the school’s ALP is to provide a platform to mould students to be more confident speakers. The strategy to achieve this goal is through the Hildan approach to teaching thinking through English Language learning (iTHINK). Students are equipped with 21 Century Competencies (21CC) skills such as analytical and critical thinking skills, perspective taking and effective communication skills

Different level has different focus. At Secondary One, the programme focuses on building confidence and forming opinions through the TOASTMASTER programme. Secondary Two students will be taught to defend their point of views through debate platform. Finally, at upper secondary level, students will learn to cultivate advocacy and eventually refining their skills towards achieving distinction in oral communication.
