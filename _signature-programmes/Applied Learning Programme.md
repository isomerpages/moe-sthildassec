APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME
--------------------------

**Programme Overview**

<style>{ margin:0;}  </style> St. Hilda’s Secondary School embarked on the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - iTHink: The Hildan Approach to teaching thinking through English Language learning in 2015 with the Secondary One cohort. English Language was the platform to develop critical thinkers and effective communicators, an outcome that is aligned to MOE’s ALP initiative of connecting academic knowledge and thinking skills with the real world.  Lessons are designed to engage students in the co-construction of learning new knowledge as they develop 21st century competencies and the desired disposition of being future ready. In addition, the intended outcomes for each level are achieved through various programmes:</p>




| Level | Focus | Programmes |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Secondary One   | Build confidence and form opinions     | Drama in Education Programme     |
| Secondary Two | Justify point of view | Integrated Learning Journey and Debating Skills Workshop
 |Secondary Three | Cultivate advocacy | Secondary Three Integrated Project |
 
<style>{ margin:0;}  </style> Hildans completing the ALP programme over the four/five years of their secondary school life would exhibit the Hildan Distinctive - a Confident, Caring and Disciplined Leader.
 
The progression of the programme is as follows:

**Secondary One Programmes**

<U>Drama in Education Programme (DEP)</U>

<style>{ margin:0;}  </style>The elements of drama in DEP help to make meaning for the students as they communicate with their classmates through verbal and non-verbal ways. In addition to developing language skills, students’ confidence will be developed as they learn to speak clearly and express their opinions with conviction. The weekly DEP lessons require students to move out of their comfort zones to create drama scripts, participate in dramatic impromptu improvisations and speak on a topic within a stipulated time both individually (Readers’ Theatre) and in groups (Dramatisation).

**Oracy Programme**

<style>{ margin:0;}  </style>To build competency in formulating points of view and strengthening confidence in speaking, students are guided to research on interesting topics before crafting their thoughts, focusing on Paul-Elder Critical Thinking Framework (Elements of Thought and Intellectual Standards). The final deliverable includes the creation of a podcast on their speech.

**Secondary Two Programmes**

<U>Local Integrated Learning Journey</U>

<style>{ margin:0;}  </style>Through the collaborative effort of the Aesthetics, Humanities and English departments, students undergo a learning journey centred on the theme of Singapore’s Heritage. This learning journey helps students to gain an understanding of how Singapore has preserved their cultural heritage in each ethnic enclave and to explore why cultural heritage is such an important part of building the Singaporean’s identity. Students get to (a) curate artefacts and anecdotes, (b) create products (tile / rap / food items) that represent the Singaporean identity and © advocate to their peer, school, community about the importance of preserving our cultural heritage. 

**In-Class Debates**

<style>{ margin:0;}  </style>To nurture students to become effective thinkers and communicators, students undergo a series of writing and speaking lessons. They research on primary issues in a given topic and discuss their thoughts in the classroom. The lessons and preparation culminate in class debates where students present cogent and coherent arguments.

<U>Secondary Three Integrated Project</U>

<style>{ margin:0;}  </style>The Sec 3 Integrated Project focuses on three disciplines – Social Studies (Issue Investigation), Character & Citizenship Education (Values in Action) and English Language (Advocacy). It provides the opportunity for Sec 3 students to think deeply on social issues faced by Singapore, demonstrate the 21st Century Competencies to become informed, concerned and participative citizens, and be empowered to be effective advocates for a good cause. Adopting the SOLVE approach, students work in groups to examine an issue critically, propose solutions and put their recommendations in action as they serve in different organisations to meet the needs of the community.
