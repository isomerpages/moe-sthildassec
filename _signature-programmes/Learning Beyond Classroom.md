Learning Beyond Classroom
----------------------

A signature experiential programme that completes the Hildan experience of every Hildan is the Learning Beyond Classroom (LBC) programme. The three-day school-wide programme was aligned and tailored to each level focus.

Secondary One students experienced a day camp to develop a growth mindset as they explored and adapted to secondary school life. They were initiated to integrated learning of Biology and Geography through field studies and investigation which also incorporated outdoor education skills.

Secondary Two students were immersed in integrated learning experiences requiring lateral thinking across disciplines such as Humanities, English Language and Art through a learning journey to the Peranakan Museum, Joo Chiat heritage sites and Our Tampines Hub. In yet another learning journey, outdoor education skills were also seamlessly weaved in with Mathematical thinking and Social Studies perspectives as students navigate their way through Labrador Park. What is outdoor education without the sun and the sea? Secondary Two students experienced kayaking and Secondary One students learned about teamwork through dragon boating.

Secondary Three students learned how to care for self through financial literacy games and care for others by connecting with non-profit organisations to understand and address their needs.

In challenging the Secondary 4 and 5 students to take action to pursue their aspirations, the school organised the Education Career Awareness Day which included a sharing on Direct School Admission and Early Admission Exercise so that students can make informed decisions for their post-secondary education options. Their highlight for the week was a grooming workshop followed by a fine dining experience.
