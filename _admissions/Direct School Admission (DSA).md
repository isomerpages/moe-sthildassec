<h2>DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION (DSA)</h2>
<h3>St Hilda’s Secondary - Direct School Admission (DSA-Sec) for 2025 Secondary One Students</h3>
<p>St Hilda’s Secondary School (SHSS) would like to invite Primary 6 students
to apply for admission to Year 1 in 2025 under the Direct School Admission
into secondary schools (DSA-Sec) scheme.</p>

to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific
academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate
beyond the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). Primary 6 (P6) students
who do not participate in the DSA-Sec will continue to seek admission based
on their PSLE score through the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting.</p>
<h4><strong>DSA Talent Area</strong></h4>
<p>SHSS welcomes students who are keen to develop their talent through 6
sports:</p>
