NATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMME
----------------------------

NDP Carnival
------------

SHSS is privileged to work with People's Association and Tampines PCF Kindergarten to put up this year's National Day Observance Ceremony held on 8 Aug 2014 at Tampines Central Park @ Tampines St 83. We are very honoured to have our very own Education Minister and Advisor to the Tampines GRC, Mr Heng Swee Keat, as our Guest of Honour, for that day. 

We also had a Carnival after the ceremony. All proceeds from the carnival sales were donated to St Andrew's Community Hospital.

    <div>

      <p>This "SG50 lantern" depicting our Singapore Flyer, is made from a bicycle rim, empty green tea bottles, a discarded toy race car, a piece of PVC pipe found in a recycle bin, plywood from an old bedframe, and decorations from a Christmas tree such as light bulbs and  tinsel garland.  
  
It belongs to Mr Chew Chyle Leng of D&T Department who has a hobby of making lanterns from recycled items for more than 20 years.  This SG50 Lantern entered the single-person competition organised by Singapore Expo on 18th Sept 2015 at Hall 6 for the event entitled ‘Celebrating SG 50’.</p>
