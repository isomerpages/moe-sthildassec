NATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMME
----------------------------

NDP Carnival
------------

SHSS is privileged to work with People's Association and Tampines PCF Kindergarten to put up this year's National Day Observance Ceremony held on 8 Aug 2014 at Tampines Central Park @ Tampines St 83. We are very honoured to have our very own Education Minister and Advisor to the Tampines GRC, Mr Heng Swee Keat, as our Guest of Honour, for that day. 

We also had a Carnival after the ceremony. All proceeds from the carnival sales were donated to St Andrew's Community Hospital.
