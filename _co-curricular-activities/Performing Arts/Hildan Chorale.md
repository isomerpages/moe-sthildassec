#### About Us

The St. Hilda’s Secondary School Choir is a SSAA (Soprano & Alto) chorale group. Also known as the Hildan Chorale, we attained the Distinction award for the SYF Arts Presentation in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019. In 2018, we participated in the 11th Orientale Concentus International Choral Festival and attained the Silver (Grade I) award in the Equal Voices (Junior Category) and the Gold (Grade III) award in 2016. The Hildan Chorale is committed to helping the girls realise their singing potential and providing opportunities for them to showcase their talent. We believe that all the girls are stars in their own right but shine the brightest together.
