PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
-------------------

Since 1934, St. Hilda’s School has heeded the call, as an Anglican school, to provide a balanced development of mind, body and spirit for Hildans and nurture them into God-fearing citizens for our nation. As St. Hilda’s School moved to its current location in Tampines in 1988, it was then renamed St. Hilda’s Primary School and St. Hilda’s Secondary School to better meet the educational needs of our nation. Still, we are one Hildan family anchored on Godly values.

Today, at 88 years old, our school is a testimony of God’s Faithfulness through the generations, since our founding by Archdeacon Graham White. Every Hildan who walks through the gates of our school is part of our Hildan family. As Hildans, we live our lives, guided by our school values of Integrity our Anchor, Caring our Heartbeat, Commitment our Resolve and Excellence our Pursuit.

Together with our School Management Board, alumni, chaplaincy and Parent Support Group, our staff purposefully curate a quality school experience so that Hildans are Critical and Inventive Thinkers, Self-Directed and Reflective Learners as well as Caring and Collaborative Contributors. This is to nurture Hildans to be Confident, Disciplined and Caring Leaders for Life, standing ready to Go Forward to be a blessing to those around us and to the world!
