School Canteen
--------------

There are a total of 11 stalls serving Chinese and Malay food and drinks.

St. Hilda’s Secondary School is going forward with the **Healthy Meals In Schools Programme in 2016** . Our Operations Manager, Mr. Thomas Wong, had liaised with the Health Promotion Board to organise a healthy meal culinary training workshop for our canteen stall vendors at SHATEC on 16 April 2016. The canteen stall vendors learned about nutrition and healthy eating for students, as well as current HMSP food service guidelines. The instructor also put on a live demonstration and provided the vendors with some culinary Tips. Our vendors had the chance to participate in hands-on learning and food tasting. With this training the canteen stall vendors are better equipped to serve Hildans with their newfound knowledge of healthy cooking!
