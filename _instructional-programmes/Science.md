<b><u>Mission</u></b>  
To develop the love for Science by providing quality Science education that is holistic, innovative and creative. <br><br>

<b><u>Vision</u></b><br><br>


Every Student A Scientist.<br><br>


<b><u>Values</u></b>  <br>
Disciplined, Competent, Caring and Committed.<br><br>


<b><u>Guiding Principles of Science Department</u></b><br><br>


*   Students’ learning is by design and not by chance.<br>
*   Provide a quality base for students in engaged learning.<br><br>


<b><u>Objectives</u></b><br><br>


The Science team strives to align its curriculum to the 21&nbsp;st&nbsp;Century Competencies (21CC) Framework, mainly focusing on 2 domains:<br><br>


<b><i>(i) Critical and Inventive Thinking</i></b><br>

<b><i>(ii) Collaboration, Communication and Information Skills</i></b><br><br>


Based on this framework, the Science team aims to:<br><br>


*   equip our students with sufficient knowledge and understanding<br>
*   prepare our students for further studies in Science<br>
*   instill in our students an awareness of the interactions of Science and everyday life<br>
*   develop abilities and skills in our students for them to be thinking individuals who are able to work independently as well as collaboratively, to communicate effectively and to use ICT to enhance their learning<br><br>

<b><u>Areas of Focus</u></b><br><br>

Through the Science Curriculum, the Science team hopes for students to achieve Quality Experience in Science and Quality Results.<br><br>

*   <b>Quality Experience in Science</b><br><br>

The Science team hopes for our students, from all levels and courses, to develop memorable experiences in learning Science by providing them with out-of-classroom contexts and laboratory opportunities through the STEM (Science Through Enrichment Modules) programme.&nbsp;<a href="/files/STEM_Programmes.pdf">Click here for more details...</a><br><br>

*   <b>Quality Results</b><br><br>

The Science team strives to engage our students in meaningful learning through innovative teaching practices, achieving Sustained Value-Addedness in Academic Achievement and more importantly leading them to ownership of knowledge.<br><br>

The team employs the following strategies:<br><br>

(i) Using the Understanding by Design (UbD) framework to have better alignment in Curriculum, Instructions and Assessment.<br>

(ii) Using lesson study approach to incorporate Inquiry-based learning in the UbD re-design curriculum.<br>

(iii) Using the SHSS C.A.R.E. (Collaborative, Applied, Reflective, Enquiry) approach to develop students’ critical thinking skills in alignment with 21&nbsp;st&nbsp;century competencies and skills.<br>

(iv) Using the Predict, Observe and Explain (POE) approach or 5Es (Engage, Explore, Explain, Extend (Elaborate), Evaluate to incorporate Inquiry-based learning in the Lower Secondary Science syllabus. Critical Thinking is taught and incorporated in Lower Secondary Science by adapting Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning: 8 Elements of Thought and Intellectual Standards. A Science retreat was conducted in June so that every teacher can have a common understanding on Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning: Intellectual Standards so that we can infuse critical thinking in the teaching and learning of Science. Teachers then come together to craft rubrics based on appropriate intellectual standards such as DCLAP (Depth, Clarity, Logic, Accuracy, Precision) to assess students’ quality of critical thinking and their ability in scientific reasoning.<br>

(v) Closing the gap to attain targets set in MSG &amp; percentage distinction through close monitoring of assignments and assessments, setting of valid and effective assessments, detailed analysis of results, intervention strategies and performance advisory and banding of Science Remedial &amp; Enhancement classes.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The Lower Secondary Science syllabus has been carefully redesigned to facilitate better alignment to the Upper Secondary Science syllabus and tapping on prior knowledge and skills acquired at primary school. The&nbsp;<a href="/files/Attachment%201.pdf">Lower Secondary Modular Science syllabus (revised) (click here for more details):</a>&nbsp;has been purposefully divided into the three modules, Physics, Chemistry and Biology to provide specialised teaching for students’ learning. Each semester, students are exposed to all 3 modules.<br><br>

With effect from January 2014, the Lower Secondary Science curriculum has been revised from what was previously a 4-week cycle, to an 8-week cycle. This means that each module takes up a duration of 8 weeks to be covered. In addition, prior to the End-of-Year Examination, 1 week of revision lesson is allocated to each module.<br><br>

With more flexibility in the curriculum time, curriculum is redesigned to incorporate the school C.A.R.E. (Collaborative, Applied, Reflective, Enquiry) approach aligning to 21CC. As such, students are exposed to different experiences in the learning of Sciences (both in and beyond classrooms), as well as, being assessed in different modes of assessments The following shows the assessment mode for each module in the revised Lower Secondary Science syllabus. The assessment mode is purposefully structured in alignment to the 21 CC Framework.<br><br>

<br><br>			
*<b>Please note that there is no Mid-Year Examination for Lower Secondary Science wef 2014</b><br><br>

With this distinction among the three modules of Science, our students are better able to familiarize themselves with the subjects and to make more informed decisions when it comes to choosing their Science subject combinations in Upper Secondary.<br><br>

To further support the learning of students in&nbsp;**Lower Secondary Science**&nbsp;, the following are implemented:<br><br>

Revision of Common Notes &amp; Worksheets for Physics, Chemistry, Biology modules<br><br>

\- Structured Science Remedial/ Supplementary Programme (SRSP) after Curriculum time

<p>

The Science department has been organizing and conducting numerous enrichment programmes through STEM, introduced in 2006. The STEM programmes are conducted to expose students to science beyond the textbooks and to enrich the students with the 21&nbsp;st&nbsp;Century Competencies skills such as in the domains of&nbsp;<b>Critical and Inventive Thinking</b>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<b>Information</b>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<b>Collaboration and Communication Skills</b>&nbsp;.

The STEM programme aims to provide a memorable experience for our students and to enhance and sustain their interest and quality learning experience in Science. In addition, STEM provides the opportunities for students to participate in various Science-related competitions at a national level. These platforms build confidence in our students and allow them to gain a measure of their own achievement under the mentorship of our Science teachers, in an external assessment situation, providing them with memorable learning experiences in their secondary school years.

Professional Development
------------------------

#### Teacher's Professional Development 

*   In line with MOE’s Quality Teaching Force, the Science Department places much emphasis on the development of teachers so that teachers become Professional Learners, Collaborative Builders and Contributors in Science Education. Developing these roles in our Science teachers help them to create learning experiences that impact students’ learning.

*   All Science teachers are trained and have acted as GCE O-level School-based Science Practical Assessment (SPA) assessors in their respective discipline of Sciences.

*   All 3 Sciences (Chemistry, Physics &amp; Biology) Professional Learning Teams (PLTs) redesign critical lesson packages using the UbD backward design framework (with Stage1: EUs, EQ, Stage2: Authentic Transfer Task-ATT with standardised rubrics &amp; other assessments, Stage3: Learning Plan); revise Content &amp; Skills are aligned to between Lower Sec and Upper Sec Science disciplines; Pedagogy (includes AfL strategies, focusing on Questioning and Thinking), Assessment (includes both formative &amp; summative assessments). PLTs also adopt the Lesson Study approach and administer both quantitative and qualitative analysis of students’ learning. Analysis of processed data based on students’ results and identification of misconceptions help the Science teams to identify critical topics for future research, innovative learning and intervention.

*   ICT lessons have been designed for Sec 1 &amp; 2 Science, Secondary 3 Chemistry, Physics &amp; Biology, incorporating Self-Directed Learning (SDL) &amp; Collaborative Learning (CoL) of our students.

*   Besides working together in their respective PLTs, Science teachers as Collaborative Builders have also presented and shared their research work, best practices and expertise at the various professional platforms:

\- 2010 E6 Cluster Science Support Group Professional Sharing at Ngee Ann Secondary School

\- 2010 Singapore Science Teachers Conference

\- 2011 E6 Cluster Science Support Group Professional Sharing at East View Secondary School
