**Departmentâ€™s Mission, Vision and Objective**

<style> { margin:0;} </style>Science is used to describe the world around us. At SHSS, we aim to equip students with knowledge that can last them a lifetime! We hope to pique the interest of our students as to why our world works in a certain way and eventually develop critical thinking skills in each and everyone of our students. Through SHSS Science curriculum, we hope every student can eventually ask the most important question: Why?
