      <p>**Mission**  
To develop the love for Science by providing quality Science education that is holistic, innovative and creative.

**Vision**

Every Student A Scientist.

**Values**  
Disciplined, Competent, Caring and Committed.

**Guiding Principles of Science Department**

*   Students’ learning is by design and not by chance.
*   Provide a quality base for students in engaged learning.

**Objectives**

The Science team strives to align its curriculum to the 21 st Century Competencies (21CC) Framework, mainly focusing on 2 domains:

**_(i) Critical and Inventive Thinking_**

**_(ii) Collaboration, Communication and Information Skills_**

Based on this framework, the Science team aims to:

*   equip our students with sufficient knowledge and understanding
*   prepare our students for further studies in Science
*   instill in our students an awareness of the interactions of Science and everyday life
*   develop abilities and skills in our students for them to be thinking individuals who are able to work independently as well as collaboratively, to communicate effectively and to use ICT to enhance their learning

**Areas of Focus**

Through the Science Curriculum, the Science team hopes for students to achieve Quality Experience in Science and Quality Results.

*   **Quality Experience in Science**

The Science team hopes for our students, from all levels and courses, to develop memorable experiences in learning Science by providing them with out-of-classroom contexts and laboratory opportunities through the STEM (Science Through Enrichment Modules) programme. [Click here for more details...](https://sthildassec.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u168/docs/internal_pages/hildan_experience/science/STEM_Programmes.pdf)

*   **Quality Results**

The Science team strives to engage our students in meaningful learning through innovative teaching practices, achieving Sustained Value-Addedness in Academic Achievement and more importantly leading them to ownership of knowledge.

The team employs the following strategies:

(i) Using the Understanding by Design (UbD) framework to have better alignment in Curriculum, Instructions and Assessment.

(ii) Using lesson study approach to incorporate Inquiry-based learning in the UbD re-design curriculum.

(iii) Using the SHSS C.A.R.E. (Collaborative, Applied, Reflective, Enquiry) approach to develop students’ critical thinking skills in alignment with 21 st century competencies and skills.

(iv) Using the Predict, Observe and Explain (POE) approach or 5Es (Engage, Explore, Explain, Extend (Elaborate), Evaluate to incorporate Inquiry-based learning in the Lower Secondary Science syllabus. Critical Thinking is taught and incorporated in Lower Secondary Science by adapting Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning: 8 Elements of Thought and Intellectual Standards. A Science retreat was conducted in June so that every teacher can have a common understanding on Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning: Intellectual Standards so that we can infuse critical thinking in the teaching and learning of Science. Teachers then come together to craft rubrics based on appropriate intellectual standards such as DCLAP (Depth, Clarity, Logic, Accuracy, Precision) to assess students’ quality of critical thinking and their ability in scientific reasoning.

(v) Closing the gap to attain targets set in MSG & percentage distinction through close monitoring of assignments and assessments, setting of valid and effective assessments, detailed analysis of results, intervention strategies and performance advisory and banding of Science Remedial & Enhancement classes.</p>
