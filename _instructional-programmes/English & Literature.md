Secondary Two Local Integrated Learning Journey
-----------------------------------------------

Applied Learning Programme St. Hilda’s Secondary School embarked on the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - iTHink: The Hildan Approach to teaching thinking through English Language learning in 2015 with the Secondary One cohort. This programme seeks to develop critical thinkers and effective communicators, an outcome that is aligned to MOE’s ALP initiative of connecting academic knowledge and thinking skills with the real world. Lessons are designed to engage students in the co-construction of learning new knowledge as they develop 21st century competencies and the desired disposition of being future ready. Hildans completing the ALP programme over the four/five years of their secondary school life would exhibit the Hildan Distinctive - a Confident, Caring and Disciplined Leader.

Secondary One Drama in Education Programme (DEP)
------------------------------------------------

The elements of drama in DEP helps to make meaning for the students as they communicate with their classmates through verbal and non-verbal ways. In addition to developing language skills, students’ confidence will be developed as they learn to speak clearly and express their opinions with conviction. They also acquire thinking skills to make critical and rational judgements when they examine the Sec 1 Lit text as well as current affair issues. Helmed by the department teachers, the weekly DEP lessons require students to move out of their comfort zones to create drama scripts, participate in dramatic impromptu improvisations and speak on a topic within a stipulated time both individually (Readers’ Theatre) and in groups (Dramatisation).

Secondary One Oracy Programme
-----------------------------

To build competency in formulating points of view and strengthening confidence in speaking, students are guided to research on interesting topics before crafting their thoughts, focusing on Paul-Elder Critical Thinking Framework (Elements of Thought and Intellectual Standards). Students are required to create a podcast on their speech after seeking input from their peers and teachers.

Secondary Two Local Integrated Learning Journey
-----------------------------------------------

Collaborating with the Aesthetics and Humanities departments, students explore the theme of Urban Planning in Singapore. This learning journey helps students to recognise that strategic land use planning is necessary to bring about specific desired outcomes. It also builds awareness of how Singapore’s Peranakan heritage/culture is infused in food, architecture, activities and its importance in shaping a sense of identity and belonging. Students get to complete an authentic task of writing a letter to the Land Transport Authority of Singapore, providing suggestions on improving land use. 

Secondary Two Debates
---------------------

In order for students to become effective thinkers and communicators, students go through a series of writing and speaking lessons designed by the Sec 2 teachers.  Students research on primary issues in the given topic and discuss their thoughts in the classroom. The lessons and preparation culminate in class debates where students present cogent and coherent arguments. 

Secondary Three Integrated Project
----------------------------------

This project focuses on three disciplines – Social Studies (Issue Investigation), Character & Citizenship Education (Values in Action) and Applied Learning Programme (Advocacy). Upon investigating an area of concern in the community, students proposed an action plan to serve the need by the end of Term 3. It provides the opportunity for Sec 3 Express students to think deeply on social issues faced by Singapore, demonstrate the 21st Century Competencies to become informed, concerned and participative citizens, and be empowered to be effective advocates for a good cause. Adopting the SOLVE approach, students will work in groups to examine an issue critically, propose solutions and put their recommendations in action as they serve in different organisations to meet the needs of the community.
