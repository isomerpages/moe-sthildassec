PHYSICAL EDUCATION
------------------

####  "Healthy, Active Hildans for Life."

Overview 
---------

  

Using the three prong approaches of **Exposure, Experience and Extension (3Es)** to provide depth and breadth in physical learning (3Es). They refer to:

  

**Exposure**

Inculcating every pupil the basic skills in various sports from each of the three game categories: territorial/invasion, net/barrier, and striking & fielding, through physical education (PE) lessons and school sports programme. The programme includes appreciating and understanding the value of physical education and its relationship to a healthy, active lifestyle and to develop positive character demonstrated by sportsmanship, teamwork and cooperation.

**Experience**  

Providing ‘apex’ events and opportunities for each pupil to apply what they have learnt to improve sporting competency and reinforce learnings.

To give pupils the sporting experience that is fun and inclusive, activities in sports events are often customised to suit the different abilities of pupils and to provide various levels of challenges to engage our pupils.

  

**Extension**

Extending our lessons to take on an interdisciplinary approach to promote experiential learning and to provide teaching / learning opportunities beyond the typical ‘4-walled’ classroom.  

  

  

Vision 
-------

Develop pupils to be ‘Healthy Active Hildan (HAH) for Life’ with positive values, mental toughness and positive social behaviour including 21st CC across various experiences.  

  

  

Objective
---------

The objective of the Physical Department (PE) Department is to make physical activities a way of life, be they for recreation and well-being, personal challenge and achievement, anchored on a strong foundation of fundamental motor skills and knowledge. In addition, PE provides a good platform for building character and developing self-management and positive social skills.  

  

Programmes / Enrichment
-----------------------

**Cross Country**

Our school Cross Country is held every year at various locations.  One of the objectives of our Cross Country is to remind both staff and pupils to live healthy lifestyle. In addition, the value of perseverance is emphasized and encouraged.  

To cater for the various ability levels, our Cross Country consists of various categories eg. Biathlon, Challenge Run, Orienteering Run and Mass Run according to the intensity level.

**Sports Day**

This is much anticipated event for our students whereby students have the opportunity to participate in both field and track events. Prior to the event, students are taught the techniques of the track and field events and to imbue in them the Olympic spirit. Exciting novelty events like the ’End Game’ Challenge are included to create more participation. 

**Sports Carnival**

The aim is to give opportunity to our students to learn new sports to cater for wide range of interest and abilities. It also provide good opportunities for exploration of new interest and positive psychosocial development. Popular sports like water soccer, bubble soccer, bossaball, etc. are introduced after getting informal feedback from pupils and teachers.

**Para Games**

The main message throughout the Games is to have a heart of gratitude of how blessed we are, and to empathise with those 

who have physical limitations, yet still going strong in life (think our SG Para Athletes). Students are exposed to sports like wheelchair basketball, goalball and handicapped handball.

**Interclass Games**

  

Students have the opportunity to compete in the games learnt during their PE lessons. The competitions are mainly tiered to allow students to compete with others in similar ability groups. It provides the platform for students to foster co-operation among their teammates, making moral decisions and displaying values like fair play and sportsmanship.

**Collaborative Platforms**

Over the past four years, our Outdoor Education (OE) lessons take on an collaborative approach to promote experiential learning and to provide teaching / learning opportunities beyond the typical ‘4-walled’ classroom.  For example, students applying the knowledge learnt in ‘Ondeh-Ondeh’ dessert making lesson in the Kitchen, but using OE equipment like solid fuel burners, mess tins to boil water and adding ‘pandan’ leaves from the school garden – all in the ‘outdoor kitchen’.  Back in class, students reflected on the differences (‘compare & contrast’) between cooking in the kitchen vs the outdoors using worksheets, facilitated by the FCE teacher. 

  

For Sec 1 Geographic Investigation (GI) learning journey to Pasir Ris Park, OE collaboration includes applying map reading ‘theory’ in Geography lessons into the ‘real world’ – specifically map scales, distances, map orientation, plotting and reading 6-figure grid references.  OE also helps to guide the overall safety & conduct of the event.
