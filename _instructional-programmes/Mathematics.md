Overview
--------

Mathematics helps us better understand and describe the world around us. It is all around us, in technology, in buildings etc… Learning the subject develops thinking, competencies and dispositions that are developed through learning the subject.

  

We hope to provide in SHSS, a curriculum which is mathematically rich, offering students opportunities to learn important concepts and procedures with understanding. We hope to provide opportunities where students develop themselves as confident users of mathematics and become creative problem solvers, able to articulate and communicate their reasoning and ideas and results effectively. A place where students develop a love for mathematics and engage actively in mastering it.

  

Vision
------

Every Pupil A Problem Solver and An Engaged Learner

  

Objective
---------

To develop in students a love for Mathematics and as confident users of mathematics. To develop our students as lifelong learners who continue to grow in their chosen professions and transfer the skills and dispositions they have acquired to life and work.
