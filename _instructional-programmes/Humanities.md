#### "Every student a global citizen."

Overview
--------

**<u>Department Mission:</u>**

The humanities department seeks to instil in our students a deeper appreciation for the world they live in, and to equip them with the disciplinary skills and competencies, that will enable them to be future-ready.&nbsp;

**z<u>Department Vision:</u>**&nbsp;&nbsp;

Every humanities student a citizen of tomorrow; reflective, concerned and participative.

**<u>Key Pedagogical Approach:</u>**  

The use of inquiry is at the heart of our humanities instruction and learning. The inquiry approach seeks to empower students in their own learning and excite interest in the humanities subject.

Students undergo the four stages of the inquiry process, which are Sparking Curiosity, Gathering Data, Exercising Reasoning and Reflective Thinking.

<img style="width:50%" src="/images/Instructional%20Programmes/Humanities%202.jpg">
		 
		 
By igniting students’ curiosity, students take the lead to explore, examine and evaluate information to derive their own learning conclusions. This motivates them to think critically, and be self-directed and reflective learners.

**<u>Objective</u>**

The department aims to develop in our students the values, social-emotional competencies and an intrinsic motivation to learn by equipping them with the enduring mindsets and skillsets necessary for the 21st&nbsp;century.

We do so by adopting the Inquiry-based Approach, Visible Thinking, Intellectual Standards and Concept-based teaching in our curriculum.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<label for="accordion1">Geographical Investigation (GI)</label>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
The Geography unit seeks to develop critical and inventive thinkers through the adoption of the inquiry-based approach, which allows students to critically examine current geographical issues. <br> <br>

During the course of their investigation, students will use geographical skills acquired in the classroom to conduct investigations and analysis of their observations on current issues. This process helps students to understand contemporary environmental issues and gain in-depth knowledge that allows them to have deeper awareness about sustainable development, and their role as active citizens of the community.<br> <br>

a)    <u>Secondary One Geographical Investigation</u>  <br> <br>

Our secondary one students will be collecting data on their household usage of water through the administering of a survey, field sketch and calculation of their water footprint. Based on the data collected, they will critically examine the implications of the urgent need for a sustainable use of water as a nation, and the role they play as stewards of the environment. <br><br>

b)    <u>Secondary Two Geographical Investigation</u>  <br><br>

Our secondary two students will be investigating the issue of providing inclusive living spaces for residents in Tampines. Using the inquiry approach, students will learn how to collect and analyse primary data, and make sense of it to examine how inclusive housing is important in building a sense of belonging in local residents. <br><br>

c)     <u>Upper Secondary Geographical Investigation \[Humanities (Geography) and Geography\]</u> <br><br>

Geographical investigation provides students with opportunities to study and apply their learning of Geography to real world phenomena and related issues. Progressing from lower to upper secondary, students will continue to be exposed to the inquiry based approach through GI. They will experience out-of-class geographical investigation that includes the collecting of data at microsites within the school, and visit the East Coast Park for the study of coastal processes. The experience of outdoor fieldwork provides our students an opportunity to apply the knowledge/concepts learned in the classroom to real world context, and through it, acquire new knowledge/concepts.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<label for="accordion2">Historical Investigations (HI)</label>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
	
The History unit seeks to develop students to become critical and inventive thinkers, and to cultivate their interests in History by engaging them in the HI process through the inquiry approach.  

Through the inquiry investigation, the secondary one and two students develop a sense of curiosity by learning to ask relevant questions about the past, and have the opportunity to examine sources critically. Students will develop their ability to organise and form logical conclusions about the inquiry question posed. By working in groups, students co-build knowledge together and learn to leverage the different Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools to communicate their ideas effectively.

HI provides students with an opportunity for them to learn beyond their classroom, and to develop a deeper understanding of Singapore’s history and heritage.
