Overview
--------

**<u>Department Mission:</u>**

The humanities department seeks to instil in our students a deeper appreciation for the world they live in, and to equip them with the disciplinary skills and competencies, that will enable them to be future-ready. 

**z<u>Department Vision:</u>**  

Every humanities student a citizen of tomorrow; reflective, concerned and participative.

**<u>Key Pedagogical Approach:</u>**  

The use of inquiry is at the heart of our humanities instruction and learning. The inquiry approach seeks to empower students in their own learning and excite interest in the humanities subject.

Students undergo the four stages of the inquiry process, which are Sparking Curiosity, Gathering Data, Exercising Reasoning and Reflective Thinking.

By igniting students’ curiosity, students take the lead to explore, examine and evaluate information to derive their own learning conclusions. This motivates them to think critically, and be self-directed and reflective learners.

**<u>Objective</u>**

The department aims to develop in our students the values, social-emotional competencies and an intrinsic motivation to learn by equipping them with the enduring mindsets and skillsets necessary for the 21st century.

We do so by adopting the Inquiry-based Approach, Visible Thinking, Intellectual Standards and Concept-based teaching in our curriculum.
