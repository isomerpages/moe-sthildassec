AESTHETICS
----------

####  "Be enriched by the Arts."

Overview
--------

An integral part of holistic learner development, Aesthetics education in SHSS nurtures an appreciation of the Arts via thinking routines, building cross-cultural, social and global awareness, exposure to varied art forms, arts critique and learning by doing. Aesthetics education is key to developing students’ visual literacy to critically discern and process information so as to communicate effectively in the 21st Century. Besides enhancing students’ creative and expressive capacities, the Arts play an important role in shaping their personal, cultural and social identity, and hence how they relate with others. Our Aesthetics team comprises the Art Unit, the Music Unit as well as Visual and Performing Arts CCAs.
