**FULL SUBJECT-BASED BANDING**
------------------------------

**<u>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)</u>**

St. Hilda’s Secondary School is happy to be one of 30+ secondary schools which will implement Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2022.

**<u>Intent of Full SBB</u>**

With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs.

This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life.

By 2024, secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:

*   **Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2; and**
*   **Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum.**
