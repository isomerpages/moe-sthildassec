### Overview / Mission / Objectives

<style> { margin:0;} </style>
In the year 2000, the Student Council was established to lead the student body by exemplifying good attitude and conduct, and aims to serve the school with zeal and purpose. The objectives of the Student Council are as follows:
Uphold the School’s Mission and Vision.
1. To build the School Spirit through various school projects.
2. To provide a platform for Student Leaders to acquire leadership skills.
3. To nurture a heart of service within student leaders
4. To work closely with teachers and pupils in all aspects of school development and improvement

### Approach and Focus

<style> { margin:0;} </style>In 2011, we adapted the “Five practices of Exemplary Leadership” Model under “The Student Leadership Challenge (TSLC)” by James Kouzes and Barry Posner, we aspire to cultivate our Hildans in the five core practices of leadership as follows:
1. Lead by Example
2. Inspire a Shared Vision
3. Look for Ways to Improve
4. Empower Others
5. Encourage the Heart

<style> { margin:0;} </style>These practices summarise the desired skills and behaviour that we hope to see in Hildans as stated in the Student Leadership Practices Inventory. With the TSLC model as our approach, the Student Leadership Development Programme focus for each level is as follows:
* Secondary One: 	Self Leadership
* Secondary Two: 	Peer Leadership
* Secondary Three: Empowered Leadership
* Secondary Four/Five: Inspired Leadership
