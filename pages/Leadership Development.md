Overview 
---------

Established in 2000, the Student Council continues to lead the student body by exemplifying good attitude and conduct, and aims to serve the school with zeal and purpose.  
  
Members serve in the Events, Public Relations, Welfare, Junior Councillor and the Level Executives Committees, with the EXCO made up of the Head and Vice Heads of each committee.

  

At St. Hilda’s Secondary School, we believe that every pupil can be a leader, albeit with different levels of potential. Thus, our student leadership Programme strives to nurture all Hildans to become confident, caring and disciplined leaders for the common good.   
  
Strategically, the Student Leadership Programme strives to provide the following for all Hildans:   

1.  Structured leadership training;   
    
2.  Leadership opportunities both formal and informal;   
    
3.  Affirmation of and recognition for the leadership qualities.

  

<u>Student Leadership Development Programme Focus</u>

Secondary One: Self Leadership

Secondary Two: Peer Leadership

Secondary Three: Empowered Leadership

Secondary Four/Five: Inspired Leadership

  

<u>Student Leadership Development Framework</u>  
The Student Leadership Development Framework is a guiding principle that allows Hildans to develop and hone their leadership skills and qualities at the various tiers of leadership using the 3Es approach – exposure, experience and extension.
