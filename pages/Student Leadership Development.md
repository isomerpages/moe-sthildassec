# Student Leadership Development
### Vision

<style> { margin:0;} </style>Every Hildan an ambassador and leader of influence for the common good.


### Overview / Mission / Objectives

<style> { margin:0;} </style>
In the year 2000, the Student Council was established to lead the student body by exemplifying good attitude and conduct, and aims to serve the school with zeal and purpose. The objectives of the Student Council are as follows:
Uphold the School’s Mission and Vision.
1. To build the School Spirit through various school projects.
2. To provide a platform for Student Leaders to acquire leadership skills.
3. To nurture a heart of service within student leaders
4. To work closely with teachers and pupils in all aspects of school development and improvement

### Approach and Focus

<style> { margin:0;} </style>In 2011, we adapted the “Five practices of Exemplary Leadership” Model under “The Student Leadership Challenge (TSLC)” by James Kouzes and Barry Posner, we aspire to cultivate our Hildans in the five core practices of leadership as follows:
1. Lead by Example
2. Inspire a Shared Vision
3. Look for Ways to Improve
4. Empower Others
5. Encourage the Heart

<style> { margin:0;} </style>These practices summarise the desired skills and behaviour that we hope to see in Hildans as stated in the Student Leadership Practices Inventory. With the TSLC model as our approach, the Student Leadership Development Programme focus for each level is as follows:
* Secondary One: 	Self Leadership
* Secondary Two: 	Peer Leadership
* Secondary Three: Empowered Leadership
* Secondary Four/Five: Inspired Leadership

### Programme and Structure
 
<style> { margin:0;} </style>Flowing from the broader Character Development Framework, our Student Leadership Development (SLD) Framework leverages the 3’E’s approach as our guiding principle to develop Hildans and hone their leadership skills and qualities at the various tiers of leadership.

<style> { margin:0;} </style>The SLD programme has been strategically designed to provide both breadth and depth based on the student segments. Baseline training is provided for all pupils, by the level, through CCE lessons that focus on values-driven leadership as well as to equip them with the necessary social emotional competencies to lead others.
 <p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>In addition, in-house training is provided for various class committee members to prepare them for their specific roles and responsibilities.
  <p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>
Students who show a higher potential for leadership are groomed further with trainings and experiences as they take up official appointments such as student councillors and sports leaders. The training then culminates in VIA projects for the top-tiered student leaders. For example, the student councillors participated in the Famchamps Project hosted by Focus on the Family, and they advocate for positive family values in the school and share with the councillors from St. Hilda’s Primary School. The sport leaders promote healthy living by organising sports activities for the community and organising games during the East Zone Sports Carnival.
  <p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>To support the various platforms for leadership application, a structure comprising 5 sub-committees with distinct responsibilities (overseen by the EXCO) within the Student Council is set up to facilitate the implementation of school-wide programmes:

1. Student Well-Being
2. Mentorship and Training
3. Discipline and Deployment
4. Communications and Partnerships
5. Initiatives and Logistics
