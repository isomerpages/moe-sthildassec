Dear Parents/Guardians

The results of the 2022 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Normal (Academic)-\[N(A)\] and Normal (Technical)-\[N(T)\] Level Examinations will be released on Monday, 19 December 2022, 2.00pm.

Your child/ward may arrive at the school from 1.30pm onwards. He/She will be receiving their results at the Multi-Purpose Hall located at Level 4. Your child/ward should come in full school uniform or PE shirt with school skirt or pants.

We encourage all students to return to their schools to collect their results. If your child/ward is unwell or required to self-isolate due to a positive COVID-19 test result, he/she should not return to school to collect their results. SEAB has made provision for all candidates to view their results online via SEAB’s Candidates Portal ([https://myexams.seab.gov.sg](https://myexams.seab.gov.sg)) on the result release day. The results will be available for viewing 45 minutes after the official time of the result release. Alternatively, candidates may appoint a proxy for the collection of results. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification when collecting the results.
