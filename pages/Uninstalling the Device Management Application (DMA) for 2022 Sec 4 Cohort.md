Dear Parent/Guardian 
  
This is to inform you that the DMA will be uninstalled from your child’s/ward’s PLD on **30 December 2022** as he/she will be graduating from the school.  
  
After the DMA has been uninstalled, your child/ward will be able to use the PLD without the DMA. Your child’s/ward’s browsing activity will no longer be monitored and the browsing history on his/her PLD will also be deleted from the DMA system server.  
  
2. Actions required by your child/ward  
  
(I) At least one day before the DMA uninstallation **(29 December 2022)**  

Please ensure that all data on your child’s/ward’s PLD have been backed-up (e.g. saved on an external storage device or to a cloud storage) prior to the uninstallation. This will prevent any loss of important data when the DMA is uninstalled.  
  
(II) On the day of DMA uninstallation **(30 December 2022)**.  

Please ensure that the PLD is switched off from 6.00 a.m. to 11.00 p.m. and refrain from using the PLD during that period. This is to ensure that the uninstallation process, which will be done remotely, can proceed smoothly.  
  
(III) A day after the DMA uninstallation **(31 December 2022)**

You may refer to the attached document for instructions to check if the DMA has been successfully uninstalled from your child’s/ward’s PLD.

3. Technical Support  

Should your child/ward require technical assistance to perform the back-up, he/she can email the School-Based Helpdesk at [dma\_shss01@moe.edu.sg](mailto:dma_shss01@moe.edu.sg). 

If you find that the DMA in your child’s/ward’s PLD has not been uninstalled properly, please also email to the School-Based Helpdesk.  
  
Thank you.
