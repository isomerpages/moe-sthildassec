SERVICE LEARNING
----------------

In St. Hilda’s Secondary School, Service Learning (S-L) plays a crucial role in nurturing our students to become Caring and Collaborative Contributors of our nation. We strongly believe that when students serve the community, they will learn to empathise with the needs of the community, as well as equipping them with important social-emotional and 21st Century competencies.

“The act of volunteering will help foster a better Singapore, where no one is left behind… doing good for others, caring for the vulnerable and needy, deepening our sense of responsibility for one another – these will help us build a better home, where every Singaporean contributes to a caring society and in turn enjoys strong social support.”

_Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong_

Indeed, it is our responsibility to weave the fabric of our society together, in this place we proudly call ‘Home’. As part of our efforts to nurture our students to become Caring and Collaborative Contributors of our nation, St. Hilda’s Secondary School organises a Service Learning (S-L) Symposium every year to create an opportunity to engage the ‘Heads’ and ‘Hearts’ of our students in serving the community through the Graham White Lecture on Citizenship.

To take our signature programme to the next level, we extended the symposium to all secondary schools in Singapore to provide sharing of ideas amongst teachers so as to achieve the larger goal of effective educating and mobilising our students to be useful Citizens. Concurrent sessions are planned after the lecture for teachers to learn from other schools. This biennial programme which leverages partnership with schools and organisations have indeed made learning more holistic for both teachers and students, as we equip our young ones to carry the Hildan Legacy forward.
