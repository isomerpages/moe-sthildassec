### Dear SHSS Alumnus, 

#### Announcement

SHSS is a designated polling station for the Presidential Elections (PE) on 1st September 2023. With that, the school needs to be vacated early on 31st August 2023.
In addition, due to the PE preparations, we will be having our Teacher's Day celebrations in the morning of 31st August 2023 in the classrooms instead of the MPH. As such, most teachers will not be available.

Therefore, we advice that you **do not** come visit your ex-teachers on 31 August 2023.

If you would like to meet your teachers, you could arrange to catch up with your teachers on another day! Please contact them via email or any other electronic means to confirm their availability that they will be in school. You can find a list of emails here:

We look forward to seeing you!
