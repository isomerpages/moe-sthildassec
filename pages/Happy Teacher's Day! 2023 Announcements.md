### Dear SHSS Alumnus, 

As the school is used for Polling Day on 1st September 2023 and the school needs to be vacated early on 31st August, ex-students may only visit on **Wednesday 30th August** from **11am-1pm**. 

If you would like to meet your teachers, please contact them via email or any other electronic means to confirm that they will be in school. You can find a list of emails here:

[https://www.sthildassec.moe.edu.sg/about-shss/staff/](https://www.sthildassec.moe.edu.sg/about-shss/staff/)

Alternatively, you could also arrange to catch up with your teachers on another day!

We look forward to seeing you!
