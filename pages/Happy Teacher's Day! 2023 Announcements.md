### Dear SHSS Alumnus, 

As the school is used for Polling Day on 1st September 2023 and the school needs to be vacated early on 31st August, ex-students may only visit on **Wednesday 30th August** from **11am-1pm**. 

SHSS is a designated polling station for the Presidential Elections on 1st September 2023. 

We will be having our Teacher's Day celebrations in the morning of 31st August 2023, and most teachers will be in the classrooms instead of MPH. 

Most of our teachers are also serving as officials for the Presidential Election and will have to leave the school by 11am for the election preparations. 

If you would like to meet your teachers, please contact them via email or any other electronic means to confirm that they will be in school. You can find a list of emails here:

Alternatively, you could also arrange to catch up with your teachers on another day!

We look forward to seeing you!
