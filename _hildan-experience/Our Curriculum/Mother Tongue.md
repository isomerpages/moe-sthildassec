**How We Nurture**

**_Exposure_** – The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) syllabuses aim to develop students to become active and proficient users of the MTL through a curriculum that revolves around the three broad curricular objectives of Communication, Culture and Connection. Through enhanced emphasis on culture and regular exposure to literary texts and contemporary issues, students acquire the skills of listening, speaking, reading, writing as well as spoken and written interaction. In the process, they are strengthened in their global and cross-cultural awareness.

**_Experience_** – Adopting a learner-centred mindset, teachers utilise effective questioning and tap on ICT affordances to allow more opportunities for students to think, reflect, share, discuss and debate relevant issues related to MTL.  

Additionally, teachers plan for learning experiences that systematically infuse the myriad cultures and situate the learning of language skills in authentic situations to enable students to appreciate MTL as a living language that is relevant to their daily lives. Such platforms include:

* Annual MTL Fortnight
* CL/ML Cultural Programme Exposure (annual)
* 2023: ‘Who is the One?’ Immersive Detective game; ‘Xin Kong Xia’ Xinyao Music Appreciation Session

**_Extension_** –To deepen learning, selected groups of students participate in special programmes and competitions organised by MOE Curriculum Planning and Development Division (CPDD), Language Centres and various learning institutions to showcase their language proficiency.
