**How We Nurture**

**_Exposure_** \- POA and EBS students can connect concepts and skills learnt to their everyday lives through authentic tasks reflecting real business context.

**_POA_**: Students understand how businesses measure and communicate their performance and make use of both accounting and non-accounting information related to their businesses to make decisions.

**_EBS_**: Students are given an opportunity to learn foundational business knowledge, transferable employability skills and values that will enable them to succeed in future areas of study and work.

**_Experience_** – To enhance experiential learning and bring subjects to life.

**_POA_**:Students understand business decision-making through peer deliberation on authentic business decision-making through scenarios-based questions. Students also have the opportunity to process business transactions through a simplified accounting software to experience the computerised accounting process.

**_EBS_**: EBS students experience Business Investigation by navigating the process of market research to gather, analyse information to make informed decisions about the marketing mix of authentic businesses.
