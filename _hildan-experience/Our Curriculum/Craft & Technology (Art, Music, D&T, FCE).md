**How We Nurture**

**_Exposure_** – Through the curriculum, we strive to deepen students’ thinking within the disciplines, bringing them through the thinking and actions that professionals would go through, gaining deeper insights through the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, attitudes and dispositions in the respective disciplines.

**_Art_**:We train students to think and act like artists using the Art Inquiry Approach, providing them with the opportunity to give form and meaning to their ideas, thoughts and feelings through visual and tactile forms, developing them to be critical and inventive thinkers and self-directed and reflective learners.

**_D&T_**: We train students to think and act like product designers using the Design Process, engaging them in designing and prototyping ideas through applying technology. In the process, they cultivate creative, critical and reflective thinking to make sense of their learning and to develop design-related dispositions and skills.

**_FCE/NFS_**: We train students to think and act like dieticians and nutritionists, empowering them to be health-conscious and discerning consumers; enabling them to better manage their lives and others for the present and the future.

**_Music_****:** We train students to think and act like musicians, acquiring and applying musical skills, knowledge and understanding through Listening, Creating and Performing, cultivating in them a life-long enjoyment and involvement in music.

**_Experience_** – Students apply their learning through hands-on activities and project work.

Students also participate in interdisciplinary projects through learning journeys to understand the historical, cultural and aesthetic value of Peranakan heritage.

**_D&T_**:Students are engaged to solve authentic problems through the analysis of a situation presented to them, conduct market product research before ideating and developing their ideas and make a prototype using various resistant materials. Some examples include the making of stationery with cup holders and table lamps.

Also, they learn how to create and arrange their digital Music on BandLab and play popular songs on the ukulele with good tone and strumming styles.
