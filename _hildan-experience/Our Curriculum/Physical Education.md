**What We Desire**

A Healthy Active Hildan for Life

**Subjects We Offer**

* Physical Education

**How We Nurture**

**_Exposure_** – In our PE curriculum, students are exposed to a wide range of sports and outdoor activities to develop a strong foundation of fundamental motor skills and knowledge. Our curriculum also addresses the value and benefits of a healthy lifestyle. Using the Game for Life toolkit from CoachSG, our PE lessons and outdoor activities are good platforms to intentionally infuse values to develop good character and positive social skills.

**_Experience_** – To reinforce learning, apex platforms like sports events and outdoor events are organised to enable pupils to apply what they have learnt. To make students’ sporting experience that is fun and inclusive, activities in sports events are often customised to suit the different abilities of pupils, provide various levels of challenges to engage our pupils, making learning authentic and inculcating good values.

Apex Platforms

*    Sec 1 Camp
*    Cross Country
*    Sports Day
*    Sports Carnival
*    Para Games
*    Collaborative Platforms eg. Hildan Discovery

**_Extension_** – To develop our high ability students in Sports CCAs and our Sports Leaders, the Nellie Mitchell Talent Development Programme (click here), sports-related courses (e.g. strength & conditioning sessions), sports psychology, outdoor activities and experiences in the variety of roles  related to the sport are organised. Learning journeys are also conducted for students with interest in sports to explore post-secondary sports related courses.
