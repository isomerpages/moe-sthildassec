<b>What We Desire</b>

Every Hildan a scientist: critical and inventive thinker and reflective learner

<b>Subjects We Offer</b>

1.  Science
2.  Biology
3.  Chemistry
4.  Physics

<b>How We Nurture</b>

Exposure – In the Science classroom, the pedagogical emphasis is inquiry&nbsp; through discovery and expository investigations. We aim to develop inquisitive and critical learners who are curious about the world around them. Students are equipped with an enduring understanding of scientific ideas where they acquire a coherent view and conceptual framework of scientific knowledge and transfer of learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;


Experience – Students apply these knowledge and scientific skills through the various projects and programmes designed within the curriculum. Level-wide enrichment programmes such as learning journeys, talks by scientists, NParks, NEA, showcases and others, exposes students to the real-life applications of Science to increase their awareness and appreciation of Science in their everyday lives.

1.  Wonder Project - Sec 1 students&nbsp; investigate various materials of their choices to create water filtration prototypes.
    
2.  Energy Inquiry Project \- Sec 2 students&nbsp; research and enquiry more about the different renewable and non-renewable energy source options available and sustainable in&nbsp; Singapore.&nbsp;
    
3.  STEM Challenge - Organised by Singapore Science Centre and the James Dyson Foundation, Sec 1 - 5 students would&nbsp; get to work in teams and build their own prototypes to solve different&nbsp; Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) problems.&nbsp;
    
4.  STEM-X Programme - Organised by Temasek Polytechnic, Sec 3&nbsp; students&nbsp; learn more about STEM through the discovery programmes and applied learning workshops.

***Extension*** – Students with interest and/or aptitude in STEM have the opportunities to participate in various stretch programmes and competitions that will expand their learning beyond school.

Selected students will be able to take part in the Nellie Mitchell Talent Development Programme (Science) - Air-novate (click [here](https://sthildassec.moe.edu.sg/hildan-experience/our-signature-programmes/nellie-mitchell-programme/)). Air-novate is a collaboration with the James Dyson Foundation. Through this interdisciplinary programme, students learn to think like scientists in their investigation to address air pollution. Students will also exercise their creative and critical thinking and act as entrepreneurs to pitch for their air purification prototypes.

There are opportunities for selected students to participate in Science competitions such as the Singapore Junior Biology/ Chemistry/ Physics Olympiads, the Temasek Engineering Challenge (by Temasek Polytechnic) and the Youth STEM Empowerment Programme (by the Science Centre).
