**What We Desire**

Every Hildan a Problem Solver and an Engaged Learner

**Subjects We Offer**

* Elementary Mathematics
* Additional Mathematics
* Computer Applications (CPA)

**How We Nurture**

**_Exposure_** – The department aims to deepen students’ understanding of mathematics by infusing discussions about the big ideas of mathematics into lessons. This helps create coherence and connections between different topics, giving students a comprehensive understanding of the subject. Real-world applications of mathematics are incorporated to demonstrate the practical relevance of the discipline, thereby fostering positive attitudes towards learning mathematics. Blended learning, differentiated instruction, and inquiry-based approaches are utilised to enhance the learning process.

**_Experience_** – The department focuses on developing students’ mathematical processes and metacognition through structured platforms, such as the Sec 1 Statistical Investigation Project, the Sec 2 and 3 Polya Problem-Solving Lessons, and the Lower Sec Computational Thinking Programme. By participating in these platforms, students are given opportunities to justify their answers in discussions and written work, which enhances their reasoning and communication skills. Metacognition is nurtured through teachers’ modeling of thinking processes, through the use of thinking routines in class, and students reflecting on the problem-solving process. As part of the SHSS Mathematics curriculum, problems in real-world contexts and standard mathematical models are discussed, enriching students’ modeling skills and enabling them to apply mathematics in practical scenarios. Engaging tasks, such as the Sec 1 gamification package and the Sec 2 mathematics trail, provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge and skills, while fostering positive attitudes towards learning mathematics.

**_Extension_** – The department extends the learning opportunities for students with interest and aptitude in mathematics. Selected students are given the opportunity to participate in the Sec 3 Financial Mathematics Programme in collaboration with Barclays Bank Singapore and the Sec 4 Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (Senior) Training Programme to further develop their mathematical skills and knowledge. Various competitions, including the All Singapore Sec School Mathematics Competition, the National Institute of Education Mathematics Challenge, and the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (Junior), offer challenging and engaging opportunities for students to explore mathematics beyond the regular curriculum.

**Achievements**

* Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (Junior) 2023 (1 Bronze, 1 Honourable Mention)
* Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (Senior) 2023 (1 Bronze, 5 Honourable Mention)
* Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (Senior) 2022 (1 Bronze, 3 Honourable Mention)
* Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (Junior) 2021 (2 Honourable Mention)
* Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (Senior) 2021 (1 Bronze, 1 Honourable Mention)

Key Programmes
--------------

**Learning Strategies**

We adopt CPA Learning Strategies such as _“Peer Drawing”_ and _“Peer Programming”_ whereby students work in pairs to collaborate on given tasks.
