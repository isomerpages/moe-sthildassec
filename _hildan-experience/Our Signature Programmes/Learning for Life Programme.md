**‘Develop a Whole Person through Sports and Outdoor Education”**

<img src="/images/Signature%20Programmes/LLP%201.jpg" style="width:85%">


With the popularity of our sports programmes both at competitive and recreational levels and in view of sports and outdoor education as good platforms for the development of character, the school LLP is to develop a whole person through sports and outdoor education.

The outcome is to develop pupils to be ‘Healthy Active Hildan for Life’ with positive values, mental toughness and positive social behaviour, including 21&nbsp;st&nbsp;Century Competencies across various experiences, using the 3E Approach – Exposure, Experience and Extension.

**<u>3E Approach</u>**

**Exposure**

Pupils are exposed to a wide range of sports and physical activities during PE lessons and through other platforms like Sports Carnival. The selection of sports is based on pupil interest, the three games categories, and the types of sports facilities available to the public outside the school.

Affective and cognitive domains like sportsmanship, sports knowledge, tactical and mental capabilities towards developing 21CC skills are incorporated.

**Experience**

Apex platforms like sports events are organised to enable pupils to apply what they have learnt.

To give pupils the sporting experience that is fun and inclusive, activities in sports events are often customised to suit the different abilities of pupils, provide various levels of challenges to engage our pupils and to inculcate good values. At the school’s Cross Country this year, there were three categories of races (biathlon, challenge run and mass run) for pupils to select.

**Extension**

To benefit high ability pupils in Sports CCAs, the extension approach includes sports education courses, overseas training, first-aid course and experience in the variety of roles related to sports. The Hildan Sports Excellence Programme (HISPEX) started with the Volleyball Boys’ team is anchored on the philosophy of providing a holistic education for the players. Other key sports CCAs are gradually benefiting from this programme.

Pupils are also encouraged to contribute in sporting or outdoor related events and programmes with school and community focus.

**DEVELOPING CHARACTER THROUGH SPORTS AND OUTDOOR EDUCATION**

**‘GAME FOR LIFE’ TOOLKIT’&nbsp;&nbsp; - intentionally infuse values during PE lessons**

Character Development through sports is an important aspect of our Learning For Life Programme (LLP) towards ‘Developing a Whole Person through Sports and Outdoor Education’.

Our school is partnering with Sport@SG and PESTA to introduce ‘Game for Life’ Toolkit to our PE lessons. The Toolkit features the use of game activities to infuse values and attributes for every individual. Values like discipline, teamwork, care are infused into our PE modules of Volleyball, Badminton and Softball.

To further reinforce these values, the school invited National athletes like our alumni Ms Charmaine Soh (Singapore Netball goal shooter), Ms Yip Pin Xiu (ST Athlete of the Year 2015), Mr Melvin Yeo (National Runner) and Mr Kunalan to share and encourage our pupils to grow in character through sports.

Latest Updates&nbsp;
---------------

This year, the focus of our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) towards ‘Developing a Whole Person through Sports and Outdoor Education’ is on the ‘Extension’ approach. It involves fostering a positive sports culture in our sport CCAs, that would in turn facilitate the effective character development of student athletes;&nbsp;facilitating opportunities for our students with interest in sports or outdoor to deepen their knowledge on the prospect of a sport related and outdoor related courses and career; and exploring interdisciplinary outdoor education lessons with other subjects.

  

Collaborating with our LLP partner, CoachSG’s Character &amp; Leadership Development (CLD) Team, in a pilot project to foster a positive sports culture in our sport CCAs, three workshops were organised to bring together our sports CCA teachers and coaches as a collective community, to build a shared vision and commitment towards creating a culture that would enhance the quality of sporting experiences in our school.&nbsp;

  

This year, our school also forged a new partnership with Republic Polytechnic (RP) under the LLP banner. One of the initiatives is to facilitate opportunities for our students with interest in sports or the outdoor to find out more about the courses and career in the related field. Our Secondary 3 sport CCA members, Sports Leaders and interested students participated in a Learning Journey to Republic Polytechnic to try out some taster modules conducted by RP’s School of Sports, Health &amp; Leisure.&nbsp;

  

Our Outdoor Education (OE) lessons took on an interdisciplinary approach to promote experiential learning and provide learning opportunities beyond the classroom.&nbsp; For example, students applied the knowledge learnt during their Food and Consumer Education lessons to outdoor cooking through the cooking of ondeh ondeh in both settings. For the Secondary 1 Geographic Investigation learning journey to Pasir Ris Park, the OE collaboration included applying map reading skills learnt in Geography lessons in the real world world context which involved reading map scales, calculating distances, map orientation, plotting and reading 6-figure grid references.&nbsp;&nbsp;
