NELLIE MITCHELL PROGRAMME
-------------------------

**Aim**

As part of the ‘Extension’ prong in the 3E approach, the Nellie Mitchell Talent Development Programme (NMP) enables Hildans to attain peaks of excellence in a variety of domains.

We do so by growing their talents through authentic experiences, with support from an ecosystem of mentors, peers and community partners.

**Programme Framework**

Students deepen their disciplinary thinking and strengthen their thinking across disciplines through various department talent development programmes, such as in Art-English Literature, Humanities and Sciences. Sports talents identified from Direct School Admission (DSA) and our Sports CCAs, namely Badminton, Floorball, Hockey, Netball and Volleyball will continue to develop their strengths through NMP.

**Department Talent Development Programmes**

**_NMP (Art-English Literature Symbolism)_**

Integrating three disciplines (Art, English Language and English Literature) and leveraging multimodal experiences, this programme stretches Hildans’ critical thinking, research, design and innovation skills via rich exposure to varied forms of expression in the visual and literary arts. Hildans also embark on a learning journey to a museum to appreciate and study how the various elements culminate into a fine piece of work. At the end of this programme, they create a personalised work of art, comprising a drawing/3D artefact and a poem. An exhibition of these works will be organised for students to present artefacts to visitors.
