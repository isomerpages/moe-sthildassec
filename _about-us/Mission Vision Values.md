Go forward together one and all  
Forward onward, whatever may befall  
Let’s raise our heads high and lift our voice  
Service to others is the Christian’s choice!  
  
Go forward, onward, over to the right  
In service and brotherhood and love  
Forward and upward, ever to the light  
Go forward and serve our Lord above!  
St. Hilda’s our Alma Mater dear  
  
Go forward in her and have no fear  
She is our teacher, parent and friend  
Whatever our path, wherever we wend!

School Hymn
-----------


Far in the golden East there lies a shore  
Where God Almighty doth His blessing pour  
On sea-washed shores, our Nation, Singapore&nbsp;  
Alleluya, Alleluya

Here too at peace dwell men of every race  
Chinese, Malay and Indian interlace  
One heart, one hope, guided by God’s good grace  
Alleluya, Alleluya

Long may our country rest in wealth and peace  
Forever bound by love and righteousness  
‘Neath God’s good hand stretch’d forth  
to guard and bless  
Alleluya, Alleluya
