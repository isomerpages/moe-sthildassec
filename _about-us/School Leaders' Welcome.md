2024 PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
-------------------

Since 1934, St. Hilda’s School has heeded the call, as an Anglican school, to provide a balanced development of mind, body and spirit for Hildans and nurture them into God-fearing citizens for our nation. As St. Hilda’s School moved to its current location in Tampines in 1988, it was then renamed St. Hilda’s Primary School and St. Hilda’s Secondary School to better meet the educational needs of our nation. Still, we are one Hildan family anchored on Godly values.

Today, at 90 years old, our school is a testimony of God’s Faithfulness through the generations, since our founding by Archdeacon Graham White. Every Hildan who walks through the gates of our school is part of our Hildan family. As Hildans, we&nbsp;live our lives, guided by our school values of Integrity our Anchor, Caring our Heartbeat, Commitment our Resolve and Excellence our Pursuit.

Together with our School Management Board, alumni, chaplaincy and Parent Support Group, our staff purposefully curate a quality school experience so that Hildans are Critical and Inventive Thinkers, Self-Directed and Reflective Learners as well as Caring and Collaborative Contributors. This is to nurture Hildans to be Confident, Disciplined and Caring Leaders for Life, standing ready to Go Forward to be a blessing to those around us and to the world!

<style> { margin:0;} </style>Every Hildan is a precious individual entrusted to us to guide them in their learning journey!
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>We believe in having “Integrity our Anchor” in daily living, “Caring our Heartbeat” in our relationships with one another and “Commitment our Resolve” in achieving the best for our students and for ourselves.
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>St. Hilda’s Secondary School has a rich history of moulding young minds with the mission that every student lives a God-fearing purposeful life, impacting their families, friends and our nation.
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>I believe that every student has potential and this journey of uncovering their potential is a partnership between the school, parents, community partners and stakeholders. It is indeed a privilege and&nbsp;honour&nbsp;to be part of the Hildan family and I look forward to walking this learning journey with you in helping our students achieve a holistic education in this season of time.

<style> { margin:0;} </style>I count it a privilege to be a part of St. Hilda’s Secondary School. It is not only a school but also an extended family that traces back to many generations of outstanding individuals who love and serve others, our nation and God.
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>It is my desire that together with my colleagues and key stakeholders, we could give our students the “roots and wings” via their experiences in SHSS. By roots, I am referring not only to inculcating the desired values in students. It is also needful to make them feel safe, loved and secured so that they develop the sense of belonging and identity to the community. By wings, I hope the students will be excited to seize the myriad of learning opportunities to explore and pursue their passions. With the relevant knowledge, skills and dispositions, they will then be well prepared to lead a fulfilled life that God has intended for each of them.
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style> I look forward to partnering you to establish SHSS as a choice school that provides a joyful and holistic learning experience for every student.

<style> { margin:0;} </style>I thank God for having the privilege to be part of the Hildan family, to serve and lead alongside my colleagues to nurture and shape our students to be leaders for life, poised and ready to embrace the future and its challenges.&nbsp;
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>Our school stands out for its unique Hildan Distinctive, where we foster an environment that nurtures students to be confident, disciplined, and caring leaders for tomorrow. My aspiration is for each Hildan to discover their potential, develop their talents, and grow into well-rounded individuals who can continually serve and contribute to the community and the nation.&nbsp;
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>It is my honour to partner and collaborate with you, our community and stakeholders in the endeavor to nurture our students. As we embark on this journey together, let us be reminded of the Hope that God has instilled in us. Despite the challenges that we may encounter in the future, let us persevere and thrive, anchored by Godly values and an open mindset that enables adaptation and growth.
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>As our school motto reminds and encourages us, let us Go Forward together!
