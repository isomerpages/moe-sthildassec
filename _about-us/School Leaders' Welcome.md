2024 PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
-------------------

Since 1934, St. Hilda’s School has heeded the call, as an Anglican school, to provide a balanced development of mind, body and spirit for Hildans and nurture them into God-fearing citizens for our nation. As St. Hilda’s School moved to its current location in Tampines in 1988, it was then renamed St. Hilda’s Primary School and St. Hilda’s Secondary School to better meet the educational needs of our nation. Still, we are one Hildan family anchored on Godly values.

Today, at 90 years old, our school is a testimony of God’s Faithfulness through the generations, since our founding by Archdeacon Graham White. Every Hildan who walks through the gates of our school is part of our Hildan family. As Hildans, we&nbsp;live our lives, guided by our school values of Integrity our Anchor, Caring our Heartbeat, Commitment our Resolve and Excellence our Pursuit.

Together with our School Management Board, alumni, chaplaincy and Parent Support Group, our staff purposefully curate a quality school experience so that Hildans are Critical and Inventive Thinkers, Self-Directed and Reflective Learners as well as Caring and Collaborative Contributors. This is to nurture Hildans to be Confident, Disciplined and Caring Leaders for Life, standing ready to Go Forward to be a blessing to those around us and to the world!

<style> { margin:0;} </style>Every Hildan is a precious individual entrusted to us to guide them in their learning journey!
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>We believe in having “Integrity our Anchor” in daily living, “Caring our Heartbeat” in our relationships with one another and “Commitment our Resolve” in achieving the best for our students and for ourselves.
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>St. Hilda’s Secondary School has a rich history of moulding young minds with the mission that every student lives a God-fearing purposeful life, impacting their families, friends and our nation.
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>I believe that every student has potential and this journey of uncovering their potential is a partnership between the school, parents, community partners and stakeholders. It is indeed a privilege and&nbsp;honour&nbsp;to be part of the Hildan family and I look forward to walking this learning journey with you in helping our students achieve a holistic education in this season of time.

<style> { margin:0;} </style>I count it a privilege to be a part of St. Hilda’s Secondary School. It is not only a school but also an extended family that traces back to many generations of outstanding individuals who love and serve others, our nation and God.
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>It is my desire that together with my colleagues and key stakeholders, we could give our students the “roots and wings” via their experiences in SHSS. By roots, I am referring not only to inculcating the desired values in students. It is also needful to make them feel safe, loved and secured so that they develop the sense of belonging and identity to the community. By wings, I hope the students will be excited to seize the myriad of learning opportunities to explore and pursue their passions. With the relevant knowledge, skills and dispositions, they will then be well prepared to lead a fulfilled life that God has intended for each of them.
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style> I look forward to partnering you to establish SHSS as a choice school that provides a joyful and holistic learning experience for every student.

<style> { margin:0;} </style>The Singapore education system has evolved and grown over the years, moving from being efficiency-driven in the early 1960s-70s to its current emphasis on values education and a system that caters variously to the different talents and aspirations of our young. There is an impetus for schools to carve out their individual niche areas and establish peaks of excellence for themselves. Schools are also to equip our youth with the pre-requisite subject knowledge and associated disciplinary skills and values that will enable them to navigate their way in the world of the 21st century effectively.&nbsp;
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>Strong leadership, working hand in hand with a professional team of teachers would be critical in helping us achieve these goals. Leading and managing a school for the 21st century would involve more that effective strategic planning and administration. It certainly calls for school leaders and middle managers who are instructional leaders as well. A key role as instructional leaders is to better lead and engage our teacher colleagues in the review of existing classroom practices and to substantiate their practices with sound pedagogical principles and theories of learning. This, in my mind, would be one of the levers that would lead to breakthrough teaching and learning, to move beyond the traditional chalk and talk, and rote learning to the test.&nbsp;
<p></p>
<style> { margin:0;} </style>Towards this end, we, at St Hilda's Secondary, hope to build a vibrant learning environment where like-minded professionals work towards growing the varied talents and aspirations of all Hildan students.
