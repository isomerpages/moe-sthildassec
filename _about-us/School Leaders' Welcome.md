<p><strong><u>Principal's Message</u></strong>
</p>
<p>A very warm welcome to St. Hilda’s Secondary School. I am deeply honoured
and privileged to be entrusted the opportunity to lead a school steeped
in rich history and tradition of excellence and I am grateful to build
upon the strong and enduring foundations laid by Mrs Janice Lim and the
esteemed leaders who came before her. Their steadfast commitment had shaped
St. Hilda’s into the vibrant institution it is today.</p>
<p>Our school’s vision, ‘<strong>One Hildan Family anchored on Godly Values - Every Hildan, A Leader for Life’</strong>,
espouses the character and values that we aspire for our students. It reflects
our belief in nurturing a community where every student feels a deep sense
of belonging, supported by a strong moral compass rooted in our school
values of Integrity Our Anchor, Caring Our Heartbeat, Commitment Our Resolve
and Excellence Our Pursuit. These values not only guide our students during
their time here but also equip them to lead purposeful and impactful lives,
preparing them to be future-ready students and to learn beyond the school
years.</p>
<p>We believe that every Hildan has the potential to be a leader in their
unique way, whether through serving others, excelling in their pursuits,
being a source of inspiration and encouragement or impacting the communities
that they are in. We hope to nurture our Hildans to be able to positively
influence and uplift others, grounded in character and a heart for service.</p>
<p>Our core focus is our <strong>Hildan Distinctive</strong> — to nurture our
students to become <strong>Confident</strong>, <strong>Disciplined</strong>,
and <strong>Caring Leaders</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Confident</strong>
</p>
<p>We emphasise on developing each Hildan to be a <strong>Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinker</strong>.
A Hildan who is engaged purposefully, exercises sound reasoning based on
godly values, offers new ideas and alternative solutions, and communicates
effectively with clarity and conviction and is able to adapt to changes
and challenges. Every Hildan is a Confident leader for life.</p>
<p><strong>Disciplined</strong>
</p>
<p>We aim to nurture each Hildans into <strong>Self-directed and Reflective Learners</strong>.
A Hildan who is encouraged to adopt a curious and open mindset, reflect,
take responsibility for their own learning and perseveres in lifelong pursuit
of learning so that they can adapt to the challenges in new and unfamiliar
context. Every Hildan is a Disciplined leader for life.</p>
<p><strong>Caring</strong>
</p>
<p>We focus on developing each Hildan to be a Caring and Collaborative Contributor.
A Hildan who exercises initiative, works effectively in teams, understands
global context and issues and cares to make a positive difference within
and beyond our community. Every Hildan is a Caring leader for Life.</p>
<p>Through our school’s intentional approach in designing and curating activities
and experiences, we seek to develop each and every student into a Hildan
Distinctive. This is achieved through many of our school programmes including
our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) — iThink: The Hildan Approach to Teaching
Thinking through English Language, our Learning for Life Programme (LLP)
— Developing the Whole Person through Sports and Outdoor Education, and
the Nellie Mitchell Talent Development Programme, which nurtures and stretches
students to attain peaks of excellence across various domains.</p>
<p>As we embark on this journey together, let us be reminded of the hope
that God has instilled in each of us. It is my honour to partner with you
as we walk this path side by side, working towards a shared vision. I look
forward to collaborating closely with our dedicated teachers, supportive
parents, our passionate students, stakeholders and the community. Together,
we will continue the legacy of St. Hilda’s, while embracing new opportunities
for growth and transformation.</p>
<p>Let us, as <strong>One Hildan Family</strong>, strive to create an environment
where every individual is empowered to flourish, contribute meaningfully,
and make a difference.</p>
<p>As our school motto reminds and encourages us, let us <strong>Go Forward</strong> together!</p>

<p><strong><u>Vice Principal's Messages</u></strong>

<p><strong>Mdm So Mun Yee</strong>

<p>I count it a privilege to be a part of St Hilda’s Secondary School. It
is not only a school but also an extended family that traces back to many
generations of outstanding individuals who love and serve others, our nation
and God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is my desire that together with my colleagues and key stakeholders,
we could give our students the “roots and wings” via their experiences
in SHSS. By roots, I am referring not only to inculcating in students the
desired values. It is also needful to make them feel safe, loved and secured
so that they develop the sense of belonging and identity to the community.
By wings, I hope the students will be excited to seize the learning opportunities
to explore and pursue their passions. With the relevant knowledge, skills
and dispositions, they will then be well prepared to lead a fulfilled life
that God has intended for each of them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let’s go forward as One Hildan Family to establish SHSS as a choice school
that provides a joyful and holistic learning experience for every student.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Goh Wee Siong Jared</strong>
</p>
<p>I am both privileged and humbled to serve as Vice-Principal in the St.
Hilda’s family. Rooted in its Anglican faith tradition and rich legacy,
the school seeks to nurture generations of Hildans guided by the Word of
God and anchored in Godly values. I resonate deeply with our core values:
Integrity our Anchor, Caring our Heartbeat, Commitment our Resolve, and
Excellence our Pursuit. Together, these values serve as a moral compass
for Hildans as they navigate the complexities of the world. It is my belief
that the holistic educational experiences we provide would nurture these
values, cultivating character, resilience, and compassion in each Hildan.</p>
<p>Our vision is to prepare every Hildan to be A Leader for Life. In doing
so, I draw inspiration from God’s call for His followers to be the salt
of the earth and the light of the world. As salt, our students are encouraged
to stand for truth and righteousness and bringing forth positive change
in their spheres of influence. As light, they are called to illuminate
their communities shinging brightly as beacons of faith and service.</p>
<p>As we embark on this journey together, I look forward to partnering with
our dedicated staff, parents and the wider community. United in purpose
and faith, we will continue to honour the past, embrace the present, and
together go forward steadfastly into the future.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Loy Wee Jin</strong>
</p>
<p>Every Hildan is a precious individual entrusted to us to guide them in
their learning journey!</p>
<p>We believe in having “Integrity our Anchor” in daily living, “Caring our
Heartbeat” in our relationship with one another and “Commitment our Resolve”
in achieving the best for our students and for ourselves.</p>
<p>
<br>St Hilda’s Secondary School has a rich history of moulding young minds
with the mission that every student lives a God-fearing purposeful life,
impacting their families, friends and our nation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I believe that every student has potential and this journey of uncovering
their potential is a partnership between the school, parents, community
partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is indeed a privilege and honour to be part of the Hildan family and
I look forward to walking this learning journey with you in helping our
students achieve holistic education in their season of time with us.</p>
