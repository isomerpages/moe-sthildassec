CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
------------------------


Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) play a significant role in every secondary student's learning experience by adding vibrancy to their school life. To engage students and to instill commitment, an array of Co-Curricular Activities is offered. To further develop students' potential, enriching holistic activities and programmes have been planned and implemented. These help students discover their talents and cultivate their character through regular training by qualified coaches, regular inter-school and intra school competitions, learning journeys and projects. Students are also given opportunities to hone their leadership skills, imbuing in them the desire for excellence, a strong personal commitment to the community and the determination to achieve their potential.
