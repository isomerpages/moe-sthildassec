<p><strong>School History</strong>
</p>
<p>St Hilda’s Secondary started as Bethel English School in 1929 on Ceylon
Road in Katong. In 1934, Archdeacon Graham White acquired the school and
affiliated it to the Anglican Diocese. In 1938, the school was renamed
St Hilda’s School after the school’s patron saint, Princess Hilda of Whitby.
The essence of the school’s aims and inspirations was captured in the Mosaic
command, ‘Go forward’ (Exodus 14:15), which has since become the school
motto.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During the Second World War, St. Hilda’s School came under the jurisdiction
of the Japanese military authorities and functioned as a Japanese school.
Following the end of the war in 1945, St Hilda’s School was the first private
school to be reopened with a staff of 20 and an enrolment of 615 students
comprising mainly overaged girls and boys. In 1950, the school was accorded
grant-in-aid status by the government and it became an all-girls school.
In 1965, the school changed the skirt design from a solid blue colour to
the current design of tiny circles dotting a navy background. The school
building underwent a major overhaul in 1969, and the new campus was consecrated
in the following year. In 1984, the school commemorated its golden jubilee,
which culminated in a Thanksgiving and Dedication Service at St Andrew’s
Cathedral on 8 May.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1988, St Hilda’s School relocated to Tampines and split into two schools
due to the increasing demand for better facilities to meet future needs.
In the following year, St Hilda’s welcomed its first batch of 165 primary
school and 109 secondary school male students. On 28 July 1990, St Hilda’s
Primary School and St Hilda’s Secondary School were officially opened by
then Senior Minister of State for Education Dr Tay Eng Soon. Bishop Moses
Tay consecrated the two schools.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In commemoration of its 70th anniversary, St Hilda’s published Hildan
Harvest, which records the school’s history since its founding in 1934.
On 13 April 2012, then Minister for Education Mr Heng Swee Keat officially
opened the new Student Activity Centre, which houses a multipurpose hall,
two indoor sports halls and Singapore’s first roof-top full-size hockey
pitch. In 2014, the school celebrated its 80th anniversary with a series
of events centred on the theme, ‘Run with Endurance, Race with Joy’, which
culminated in the sealing of a time capsule containing significant artefacts
that would be unearthed during the school’s 100th anniversary. In 2019,
the school celebrated its 85th anniversary with a line-up of events jointly
organised with St Hilda’s Primary School. In 2024, the school celebrated
its 90th anniversary with 90 acts of kindness and a combined schools Founder's
Day with St. Hilda's Primary School.</p>

<p>The school badge embodies the aims and aspirations of St Hilda’s. Its
circular shape symbolises unity within the diversity of people, creeds
and cultures in Singapore. At the centre of the badge is a Cross mounted
on a blue shield, which represents the teaching of Christ – to be of loving
service to fellow men. The blue colour on the shield represents a forward
movement through waters of uncertainty, while the shield symbolises perseverance
in heavenly aspirations grounded on earthly realism through education.
Below the Cross is the school motto, ‘Go Forward’.</p>
<p><strong>School Song</strong>
</p>
<p>Go forward together one and all</p>
<p>Forward onward, whatever may befall,
<br>Let's raise our heads high and lift our voice
<br>Service to others is the Christian's choice!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Go forward, onward, over to the right In service and brotherhood and love
Forward and upward, ever to the light Go forward and serve our Lord above!
St. Hilda's our Alma Mater dear</p>
<p>Go forward in her and have no fear
<br>She is our teacher, parent and friend
<br>Whatever our path, wherever we wend!</p>
