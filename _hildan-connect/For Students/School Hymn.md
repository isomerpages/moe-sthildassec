School Hymn
-----------


Far in the golden East there lies a shore  
Where God Almighty doth His blessing pour  
On sea-washed shores, our Nation, Singapore&nbsp;  
Alleluya, Alleluya

Here too at peace dwell men of every race  
Chinese, Malay and Indian interlace  
One heart, one hope, guided by God’s good grace  
Alleluya, Alleluya

Long may our country rest in wealth and peace  
Forever bound by love and righteousness  
‘Neath God’s good hand stretch’d forth  
to guard and bless  
Alleluya, Alleluya
