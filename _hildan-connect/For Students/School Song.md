School Song
-----------

  
Go forward together one and all  
Forward onward, whatever may befall  
Let’s raise our heads high and lift our voice  
Service to others is the Christian’s choice!  
  
Go forward, onward, over to the right  
In service and brotherhood and love  
Forward and upward, ever to the light  
Go forward and serve our Lord above!  
St. Hilda’s our Alma Mater dear  
  
Go forward in her and have no fear  
She is our teacher, parent and friend  
Whatever our path, wherever we wend!
